# Project Overview
This project is not affiliated with Google and has not been officially endorsed. I created a personal initiative to address an issue I faced with Google Photos. My goal is to provide a clear and straightforward guide so that anyone without coding experience can use it effectively and fix the lack of EXIF information in their pictures

Background
When downloading media from Google, the files usually come with a corresponding .json file which brings EXIF metadata. Unfortunately, this metadata, such as creation date, date taken, media taken and location, is not embedded in the media files. This can be a hassle for those like me who value organized photo and video libraries.

# How to Use This Project
Step 1: Install Python
Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/


Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Open the Command Prompt on Windows (press Start, type cmd, and hit Enter).
Run the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

```pip install pillow```

```pip install pillow-heif```

```pip install moviepy```

```pip install piexif```

If you encounter errors running the scripts, you might have installed Python incorrectly. Refer to helpful solutions like this Quora response: https://www.quora.com/My-Python-files-are-not-opening-in-the-terminal-Python-projectfive-py-Why-I-have-tried-several-solutions-but-none-is-working-How-can-I-solve-it

Step 3: Download the Scripts
Place the following scripts in your working folder:
1st_json_fusion_v10.py
2nd_convert_heic_to_jpeg_v1.py
3rd_date_created_fixer_v5.py
Extra step: 4th_exif_fixer_from_file_name_v5 (is within the provided zip file)

Step 4: Navigate to Your Working Folder
In the Command Prompt, type:
cd C:\path\to\your\folder

Step 5: Run the Scripts
In the Command Prompt, type:
py 1st_json_fusion_v10.py **(This script pairs .json metadata files with their corresponding images or videos.)**
py 2nd_convert_heic_to_jpeg_v1.py **(If you have HEIC files (common on Apple devices), this script converts them to JPEG format.)**
py 3rd_date_created_fixer_v5.py **(This script updates the Create Date field in EXIF metadata using the Date Taken or Media Taken information. This helps ensure your phone gallery correctly places the files in chronological order)**

Extra: Step 6: Fill Exif's "date taken" or "media created".
If your media doesn't have any EXIF information but its name carries a piece of information from when you took it, this script will update its "date taken" (for images) or "media created" (for videos).
For that you will need to extract the zip file that contains the folder ExifTool together, in the same folder you are using to work on your files.
in the Command Prompt, type
```py 4th_exif_fixer_from_file_name_v5.py```
